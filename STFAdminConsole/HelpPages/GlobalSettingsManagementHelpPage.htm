    <h3>Global Settings Management</h3>
    This is an administrative dialog that should be used very seldom.  It provides a way to edit the Global
    Settings for the Scalable Test Framework, which typically will not change.  Most of the settings are tied
    directly to functionality embedded within the framework, and the only time these values need to be updated
        is during a new installation. Note that there are specific Setting Types, and 
        their purposes are defined below.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Dispatcher</b> - this setting is used to define the list of dispatchers available within the STF installation.
    As new dispatchers come online they can be added with the proper host name and IP address.  This setting is
    on that may change more frequently than the others.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>FrameworkSetting</b> - This is a core framework setting that can change in different STF installations, but
    it is important that none of these settings are removed or portions of STF may not function properly.  These
    values will typically be configured by the administrator during installation of the framework.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>WcfHostSetting</b> - This setting defines the location for core services used by STF.  Most of these
    services are distributed on other hosts and require WCF communication information.  Note the use of a special
    "Macro" Value for some of these entries that are defined as "$Dispatcher".   These entries indicate that the
    STF service is running on the same system as the defined dispatcher, which has already been chosen by the 
    user.  This provides a way to generically specify a Value by creating an indirect reference to another setting value.
    </li>
    </ul>

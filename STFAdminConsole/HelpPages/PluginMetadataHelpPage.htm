    <h3>Plugin Reference Management</h3>
        Some Virtual Resources within the Scalable Test Framework use a plugin model for 
        extensibility.&nbsp; This dialog provide the ability to manage data in the STF 
        database so new plugins can be added and made available for use in test 
        scenarios.&nbsp; Each plugin is a standalone assembly that conforms to a defined 
        interface.&nbsp; As new plugins are written and integrated into the framework, 
        they are enabled through this dialog.&nbsp; Below is a description of the data 
        used to manage plugin references.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Name</b> - This is the name of the plugin.&nbsp; Each plugin assembly uses a 
        naming convention of &quot;Plugin.&lt;name&gt;.DLL&quot;, and the name entered in this field 
        must correspond to the name used in the assembly itself.&nbsp; For example, if a 
        new plugin was created and the assembly name was Plugin.WebAutomation.DLL, then 
        &quot;WebAutomation&quot; would be the name entered here.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>Title</b> - This defines what the user will see in the dropdown menu when 
        using the STF administration console to add a plugin to a test configuration.&nbsp; 
        It is the title or label value for the plugin.&nbsp; Typically it will be very 
        short and may be the same as the Name, but with spaces.&nbsp; For example, 
        &quot;WebAutomation&quot; as a Name may simply be &quot;Web Automation&quot; for the title.&nbsp; <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>Group</b> - This field is purely for administrative purposes and provides a 
        way to categorize any plugin that is added to the system.&nbsp; The field 
        provides a dropdown that shows any existing group names, but also allows the 
        user to enter a new group if needed.&nbsp; It helps provide an aspect of 
        ownership to the plugin which may be used by testers when they are trying to 
        find the right contact if there is an issue or question with a plugin.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>Resource Type</b> - This defines what type of Virtual Resource this 
        plugin is associated with.&nbsp; Some plugins are written to specifically work 
        with a particulary type of Virtual Resource, such as an Office Worker or Admin 
        Worker.&nbsp; Select the resource that this plugin is associated with.&nbsp; 
        Future releases of STF will allow the same plugin to be associated with multiple 
        Virtual Resources, but for now you can only associate it with one.
    </li>
    </ul>

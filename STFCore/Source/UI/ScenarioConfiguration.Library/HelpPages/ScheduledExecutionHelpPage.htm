    <h3>Scheduled Execution Configuration</h3>
        This dialog is used to define a schedule of Active and Idle periods for the workers.  
        These periods are defined as a duration of time defined by you.  Use the Days, Hours
        and Minutes as defined below to specify the diration for each segment of the schedule.
        In addition, you have the option to define how the users will transition between schedules,
        and you can also enter a repeat count.

        The diagram below shows how a set of workers may behave with a scheduled execution defined.
        
Note that this sequence will start only after the initial Worker Startup Delay completes.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Execution State</b> - There are two values here, <b>Active</b> and <b>Idle</b>.  
        You can configure your worker to cycle between Active and Idle states by 
        entering rows in the data grid and defining the state and duration for each row.  In addition
        you can specify how the segment will transition to the next.&nbsp; Note that there is nothing preventing you
           from entering adjacent rows with the same state, although it probably doesn&#39;t 
        make sense to do this.&nbsp; If you enter two rows with the same sate, it means 
        there will be no change at the transition point.&nbsp; For most uses you will create a schedule 
        that causes the workers to transation between Active and Idle for different 
        durations over a period of time.&nbsp; Your decisions on how many transitions to 
        defined and how long the workers stay in any one state will be deteremine by 
        your test objectives.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>Duration</b> - Use the Days, Hours and Minutes cells in the data grid to 
        define the overall duration for that segment.&nbsp; The actual duration value
        for each segment will be the sum of Days + Hours + Minutes.&nbsp; 
     <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>Stagger</b> - You can indicate if you want each scheduled segment to 
        randomly stagger through the state transition at the end of they segment.
        With multiple users, this will create a more gradual 
        change in load over time. If not checked there will be a sharper transition in 
        load as all workers will change about the same time.&nbsp; See the graph below 
        that shows an example of staggered and sharp transitions between states.&nbsp; A 
        sharp transition may be needed in a test to create a distinct and almost 
        immediate load on a system.&nbsp; The staggered transition would be used in a 
        test that may need to simulate a gradual change in worker activities over a 
        period of time.&nbsp; Currently the staggered transition time for each worker 
        will fall withing a range of 25% of the current segment (12.5% before or after the transition
        point).&nbsp; If the target transition point is beyond the transition boundary 
        and it is greater than the next segment, the transition point will be adjusted 
        to be no more than one half the next segment.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li><b>Repeat Count</b> - This defines how many times you want the overall schedule to 
        repeat for this test run.
    </li>
    </ul>

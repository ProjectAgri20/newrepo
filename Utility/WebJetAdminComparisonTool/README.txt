The purpose of this tool is to compare the activity log from an Epr Injector activity to a report generated by Web Jetadmin.

The Web Jetadmin report can be created by selecting Tools -> Export devices from the toolbar. In the "Select Columns" dialog, scroll down the "Available Columns" list and add a column for "Status" to the "Selected Columns" list. Then select "Next" and add all of the devices to the "Selected devices" column. Then hit "Next" twice and then "Start Export". After ahile you will be prompted to enter in the name of the file you want the export to be saved as. Enter the desired file name and hit "Save". The export should appear as a CSV file. This is the WJA report you will use in the comparison tool, it lists each device (in this case each endpoint responder) by it's IP address and it list the current Status of the device. For an accurate export, the user should scroll through the list of devices on Web Jetadmin and allow the affected devices to change their states.

The activity log file can be accessed from the STF Admin Console by selecting Session -> Session Reports from the tool bar. To create a report, use "Activity Summary" as the template, then select the Epr Injector session from the grid. Select "Create Report" at the bottom of the window and save the file. This report represents each individual Epr Injection activity, sorting them by the IP address of the Endpoint Responder and listing the state that was injected (Ready, Black Cartridge Low, etc).

In order to use the comparison tool, the user will select the Web Jetadmin report by browsing after clicking on the button labeled "..." next to the WJA report textbox. The user will also select the Activity Summary in the same manner. To compare reports, the user will select "Compare Reports"; the  results will appear in the text box labeled results. The user can clear the text box by clicking on the "Clear Log" button.

The tool works by going through the EPR Injector activity summary and getting the LATEST state injected into each endpoint responder. This means that if the test has multiple iterations, the tool will only use the LAST state for each endpoint responder. From there the tool will take the collection of unique endpoint responders found in the Activity Summary and compare them to the Web Jetadmin report by their statuses. When a discrepancy is found, a line is output to the logger by IP address that gives the expected state (from the Epr Injector activity) and the state found in the Web Jetadmin report. At the bottom of the textbox is logged the total number of mismatches detected, if the reports perfectly match up, then there will be 0 mismatches detected. If only a few are found or if a number of states from the Web Jetadmin report say ready, the user may have exported the Web Jetadmin report too soon, meaning that WJA did not finish detecting the state all of the devices. In this case, the user may want to generate another report from WJA with data that is more updated.

Exceptions are logged to the Results textbox. In many cases the user did not export the WJA report correctly or he/she may have confused the two reports.
